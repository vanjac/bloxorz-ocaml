# bloxorz-ocaml

OCaml implementation of [this classic](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-bloxorz). Play the game by running `ocaml bloxorz.ml`. Type W/A/S/D and press enter to make a move.

## Building Levels

You can use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) to build your own levels.

- Make a Tiled map using the `Bloxorz_tileset.tsx` tileset. The map should be in CSV format.
- Use the `bloxorz-map.ml` program to convert the TMX file. Run `ocaml bloxorz-map.ml level.tmx`. It will print a 2D OCaml array.
- Add the level to the `bloxorz.ml` file. Follow the format of the other levels. Levels are records with `{board, orient, pos}`. `board` is the 2D array generated by `bloxorz-map`. Orient is the starting orientation of the block, generally `Upright`. `pos` is the starting coordinates of the block, where the origin is the bottom left corner, positive X is right and positive Y is up.
- Add the level to the list at the last line of the program.
